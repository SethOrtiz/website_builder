## Components

#### Add Section Button 
- When clicked, this button opens up a menu that allows the user to select the type of section they want to create.
- MVP Section Types are as follows : Nav, Hero, SoundCloud, About, and Gallery. (these are subject to change).
- Stretch: incorporate other section types: Tour Dates, News, Videos, Ect...

#### Sections
- Contain Section Units that match the section type
- Render dynamically based on user input via the Toolbox

#### Section Units
- Individual textboxes, IMG tags, Embeded data, Ect.
- This fields will have a default value that is determined by the template. (In the case of the MVP there is only one template)
- Users will have the avility to edit these values with the Toolbox. Values should render dynamically based on user input.

### Toolbox
- Contains tools that match the section type
- Tools change when the user clicks "edit" on another section or adds a different type of section.
